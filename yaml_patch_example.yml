      answer:        >
        A hackathon is an invention marathon. Students come together to build cool
        software & hardware hacks over 24-48 hours. It's [very beginner friendly](https://medium.com/@tfogo/hackathons-are-for-beginners-77a9c9c0e000#.cj21niskl).
    - question:      "How much does it cost?"
      answer:        >
        Nothing. Attending a hackathon is free.
